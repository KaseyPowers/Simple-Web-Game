# Client = React

but later couldn't!?

## Limitations:

Keeping future flexibility in mind:

- This does use/reference Sockets (socketio)
- but does not reference next.js logic
  - I know I just put this, but will still add 'use client' since I don't think that will cause issues outside of next.js
